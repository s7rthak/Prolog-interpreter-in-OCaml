# Prolog Interpreter in OCaml (lazy evaluation)

This is a prolog interpreter that does lazy evaluation (finds solutions iff asked for) for a list of goals which is given as a query. There is also an eager version of evaluation which has been commented out in the source code where all satisfying solutions are outputted at once. The exception handling is not optimal as the purpose was to get a working model of the prolog interpreter for the assignment in the course COL226 (Programming Languages). Other instructions about the working of the interpreter are provided at runtime so we can call it an interactive interpreter. Exiting the interpreter is also very easy, type anything random. 

I have used the Batteries package which is not provided by default in OCaml so it has to be downloaded via opam (OCaml package manager). Please check that opam is installed on your system by simply typing **opam** in your terminal. If it shows usage instructions then it is installed and if it shows some error message (not found) then you can download it via the command that you get in the error message (**apt-get install opam** on Ubuntu). Then you can install Batteries using the command **opam install batteries**. The Batteries package has the module for LazyLists which provide lazy support for lists. I have used *ocamlbuild* to build my project.
